== PROJECT: HMS+

== Overview

HMS+ is a hotel management system made for hotels to manage their customers and their relevant transactions.
The hotel staff interacts with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has around 15k LOC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented the complete UI except statistics
** What it does: It allows all the useful information to be visualised in a clear and user friendly way.
** Justification: This connects the user and the machine and making it simple for the user to use all our functions.
** Highlights: This enhancement required understanding of the whole codebase as the UI need to bring different parts
together to make the application easy to use.
I need to know what functions and features we have and how we want the user to use it to implement the UI in a user friendly way.
** Credits: I mainly used the concepts from the existing codebase and those that were taught in CS2103T to implement my features.
